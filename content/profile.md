## Bio Variants

### Short (one-liner)

Firmware engineer. AI builder. Bridging hardware and intelligence.

### Medium

I'm a firmware engineer who builds AI systems. UIUC grad, worked at GE Aerospace and Intel, now at Solidigm where I train engineers on AI tools and build systems that make firmware development smarter.

### Extended

AI is the biggest leverage multiplier I've seen in my engineering career. I watched junior engineers become 2-3x more productive with the right tools. That's why I champion AI adoption at Solidigm—turning skeptics into believers, one workflow at a time. My superpower is bridging deep firmware expertise with cutting-edge AI capabilities.
