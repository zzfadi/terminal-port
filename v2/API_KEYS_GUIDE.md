## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys** to version control (already handled in `.gitignore`)
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
- **Rotate keys regularly** if they've been exposed
- **Monitor usage** to detect unauthorized access
- **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary permissions

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Start with one provider** - You don't need all three API keys immediately
- **Free tiers** - Most providers offer free credits to get started
- **Rate limiting** - Be aware of API rate limits when testing
- **Fallbacks** - The app gracefully handles missing API keys

## ðŸš€ Testing Your Setup

After adding your API keys to `.env`:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Try an AI command like `ask what is TypeScript?`
3. Check the console for any API connection errors
4. Use `help` to see all available AI commands
