# {Design Name}

Create a portfolio page for the person in the attached `profile.md`.

## Concept

Inspired by The Snake Game. As a bonus, include a playable Snake game Easter egg that visitors can access by pressing the "S" key. The game should feature simple controls (arrow keys), a scoring system, and a way to exit back to the portfolio page.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Google Fonts allowed (only external dependency)
- CSS variables in `:root` for colors
- Semantic HTML (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`)
- Responsive at 640px and 900px breakpoints

## Output

Self-contained folder with `index.html`, `styles.css`, optional `script.js`.

## Footer

Include: `Built with {Model} — Part of the Zuabi.dev Gallery experiment`
